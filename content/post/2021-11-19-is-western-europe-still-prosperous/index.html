<p>    Western Europe was the region with higher levels of prosperity since its pillars used to rank first or second in all regions. And its pillar rankings have not changed significantly, except its governance, which rose from second to first in 2018. The report from European parliament shows that cohesion policy has strengthened the capacity for good governance and administration throughout Europe. This might be one reason why governance in Western Europe has increased significantly.</p>

<p>    There has been no significant change in scores for each of the pillars over the past decade, however, it is worth mentioning that living conditions has always been the main scoring point for Western European countries and social capital is relatively backward compared with other pillars. Therefore, Western European countries may need to redouble their efforts on social capital if they intend to overtake North America as the most prosperous region. However, increases in social capital are often accompanied by decreases in safety and security, which could be seen in the dynamic graph above (Click on the other elements, leaving only these two elements). So, Western European governments also need to focus on safety and security monitoring at the same time.</p>

On the contrary, the ranking decreases.)</p>

<p>    Belgium and Cyprus have two pillars on this list, so these two countries might have seen their prosperity deteriorate over the last few years. Decision makers of these countries should beware the trap of falling into a mindset of an overdeveloped society and pay more attention to strengthen their economy or social developments.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>    A decade of steadily increasing prosperity has laid a strong basis on which to build for the future of Western Europe. However, the globe has changed considerably recently, and many countries are continuing to grapple with the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19. Policymakers need to make choices that are likely to have longer-term consequences. Thus, it is important to constantly monitor changes in Western Europe’s prosperity index and rankings.</p>
